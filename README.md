# Parser

This project analyzes historical chess games to create puzzles. It replays matches to identify key positions and endgame scenarios. These are then used to generate "Mate in One" challenges for practice or entertainment.

Initially, the project will use a subset of games from the [Lichess.org open database](https://database.lichess.org/). The long-term goal is to eventually process all 5 billion games in their collection ... and maybe even more!
